# Data-Odyssey

Participated in a hackathon organized by T. A. Pai Management Institute (TAPMI), Manipal, where our task was to analyze data, predict customer churn, and create a professional presentation showcasing how various factors influence churn. Our comprehensive analysis and presentation were highly commended, leading us to secure the runner-up position in the competition.
